# CFG String Matcher

A web-based tool built with JavaScript using the Svelte framework to determine if input strings can be generated by a given Context-Free Grammar (CFG). The tool converts the grammar to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and employs the CYK algorithm for parsing, highlighting input lines that match the grammar.

## Demo

Try out the live demo [here](https://sina-salahshour.github.io/cfg-string-matcher/) to see the tool in action.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/sina-salahshour/cfg-string-matcher.git

cd cfg-string-matcher

```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

pnpm i

```

3. Run the development server:

```bash

pnpm dev

```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

- **Input CFG Rules**: Enter CFG rules in the specified format (e.g., `S -> a S b | $;`). note that for being able to use multi character variables, strings in rules are seperated by whitespace, this way you can have a variable with multiple chars like Rule1, Rule2 and etc.

- **Input Test Strings**: Provide strings to test against the grammar.

- **View Results**: The tool will highlight which strings match the grammar.
